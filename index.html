        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Trace Macias.</p>
        <p>About a year and a half ago, I wasn't sure whether I would go to school and pursue STEM or 
            if I would get a BFA in Musical Theatre. Going into my junior year of high school, I decided
            to make a big change and leave my public school to attend an arts school. I loved doing school
            musicals and wanted to be at a place that would develop my performance skills. Being thrown in 
            the middle of so many incredibly talented actors, singers, and dancers at this new school gave me a different kind of
            motivation to succeed. I worked hard, and in my senior year, I was cast as a <strong>lead</strong> in one of the musicals.
            During that quick three-month process to put the show on its feet, I immersed myself in the world of an orphaned Ukrainian rapper
            who was involved in a freak rollercoaster accident. I learned so much from being around my classmates 
            in a creative environment, as well as from my director, who was so determined to get the best out of us.
            Though I ultimately decided not to pursue the performing arts in college, I know that attending CSArts
            helped me become the person I am today. I strive to be a cast member in every group setting, contributing
            to the story passionately. I strive to deliver my words truthfully so that audiences can resonate 
            with my message. I want to be a great performer in Computer Science because I am passionate about 
            positively impacting communities, but also because I see programming as a stage of its own. Success in 
            programming relies on collaboration, commitment, and creativity, just like in a musical.
